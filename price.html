            The concept of Germany as a distinct region in central Europe can be traced to Roman
            commander Julius Caesar, who referred to the unconquered area east of the Rhine as Germania,
            thus distinguishing it from Gaul (France), which he had conquered. The victory of the Germanic
            tribes in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest (AD 9) prevented annexation by the Roman Empire,
            although the Roman provinces of Germania Superior and Germania Inferior were established along
            the Rhine. Following the Fall of the Western Roman Empire, the Franks conquered the other West
            Germanic tribes. When the Frankish Empire was divided among Charles the Great's heirs in 843,
            the eastern part became East Francia. In 962, Otto I became the first Holy Roman Emperor of
            the Holy Roman Empire, the medieval German state.

            In the Late Middle Ages, the regional dukes, princes, and bishops gained power at the
            expense of the emperors. Martin Luther led the Protestant Reformation against the Catholic
            Church after 1517, as the northern states became Protestant, while the southern states
            remained Catholic. The two parts of the Holy Roman Empire clashed in the Thirty Years'
            War (1618–1648), which was ruinous to the twenty million civilians living in both parts.
            The Thirty Years' War brought tremendous destruction to Germany; more than 1/4 of the
            population and 1/2 of the male population in the German states were killed by the
            catastrophic war. 1648 marked the effective end of the Holy Roman Empire and the beginning
            of the modern nation-state system, with Germany divided into numerous independent states,
            such as Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony, Austria and other states, which also controlled land
            outside of the area considered "Germany".

            After the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars from 1803–1815, feudalism fell
            away and liberalism and nationalism clashed with reaction. The German revolutions
            of 1848–49 failed. The Industrial Revolution modernized the German economy, led to
            the rapid growth of cities and to the emergence of the socialist movement in Germany.
            Prussia, with its capital Berlin, grew in power. German universities became world-class
            centers for science and humanities, while music and art flourished. The unification of
            Germany (excluding Austria and the German-speaking areas of Switzerland) was achieved
            under the leadership of the Chancellor Otto von Bismarck with the formation of the German
            Empire in 1871. This resulted in the Kleindeutsche Lösung, ("small Germany solution",
            Germany without Austria), rather than the Großdeutsche Lösung, ("greater Germany solution",
            Germany with Austria). The new Reichstag, an elected parliament, had only a limited role in
            the imperial government. Germany joined the other powers in colonial expansion in Africa and
            the Pacific.

            By 1900, Germany was the dominant power on the European continent and its rapidly
            expanding industry had surpassed Britain's, while provoking it in a naval arms race.
            Germany led the Central Powers in World War I (1914–1918) against France, Great Britain,
            Russia and (by 1917) the United States. Defeated and partly occupied, Germany was forced
            to pay war reparations by the Treaty of Versailles and was stripped of its colonies as
            well as of home territory to be ceded to Czechoslovakia, Belgium, France and Poland.
            The German Revolution of 1918–19 put an end to the federal constitutional monarchy,
            which resulted in the establishment of the Weimar Republic, an unstable parliamentary democracy.

            In the early 1930s, the worldwide Great Depression hit Germany hard, as unemployment
            soared and people lost confidence in the government. In January 1933, Adolf Hitler was
            appointed Chancellor of Germany. His Nazi Party quickly established a totalitarian regime,
            and Nazi Germany made increasingly aggressive territorial demands, threatening war if they
            were not met. Remilitarization of the Rhineland came in 1936, then annexation of Austria
            in the Anschluss and parts of Czechoslovakia with the Munich Agreement in 1938, and further
            territory of Czechoslovakia in 1939. On 1 September 1939, Germany initiated World War
            II in Europe with the invasion of Poland. After forming a pact with the Soviet Union in
            1939, Hitler and Stalin divided Eastern Europe. After a "Phoney War" in spring 1940, the
            Germans swept Denmark and Norway, the Low Countries, and France, giving Germany control
            of nearly all of Western Europe. Hitler invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941.

            Racism, especially antisemitism, was a central feature of the Nazi regime. In Germany,
            but predominantly in the German-occupied areas, the systematic genocide program known
            as the Holocaust killed 11 million, including Jews, German dissidents, disabled people,
            Poles, Romanies, Soviets (Russian and non-Russian), and others. In 1942, the German
            invasion of the Soviet Union faltered, and after the United States entered the war,
            Britain became the base for massive Anglo-American bombings of German cities.
            Following the Allied invasion of Normandy (June 1944), the German Army was
            pushed back on all fronts until the final collapse in May 1945.

            Under occupation by the Allies, German territories were split up, Austria was again
            made a separate country, denazification took place, and the Cold War resulted in the division
            of the country into democratic West Germany and communist East Germany, reduced in territory by
            the establishment of the Oder-Neisse line. Millions of ethnic Germans were deported from pre-war
            Eastern Germany, Sudetenland, and from all over Eastern Europe, or fled from Communist areas into
            West Germany, which experienced rapid economic expansion, and became the dominant economy in Western
            Europe. West Germany was rearmed in the 1950s under the auspices of NATO, but without access to
            nuclear weapons. The Franco-German friendship became the basis for the political integration of
            Western Europe in the European Union. In 1989, the Berlin Wall was destroyed, the Soviet Union
            collapsed, and East Germany was reunited with West Germany in 1990. In 1998–1999, Germany was
            one of the founding countries of the eurozone. Germany remains one of the economic powerhous
            es of Europe, contributing about one-quarter of the eurozone's annual gross domestic product
            . In the early 2010s, Germany played a critical role in trying to resolve the escalating euro
            crisis, especially with regard to Greece and other Southern European nations. In the middle
            of the decade, the country faced the European migrant crisis as the main receiver of
            asylum seekers from Syria and other troubled regions.
